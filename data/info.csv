1800,summary,"At the turn of the century, the United States was a new country, less than 25 years old and hardly noticable on a map.  Its population was less than that of New York City today and the western boundaries of the country
stretched to the wilderness at the Mississippi River.  At this time it took six weeks by horse to travel from New York City to present-day Chicago, which didn't yet exist.  There was no way to travel by land to the west coast and it took 
six months by ship to reach San Francisco, which had a population of less than 1000 people.  It existed only as a military outpost and religious mission."
1810,summary,"The years between 1800 and 1810 marked the first time that settlers travelled on foot to the west coast of current day America.  The Lewis and Clark expedition was commissioned in 1803 by President Jefferson to travel westward, 
find practical routes across the continent, map the newly acquired Louisiana, Southwest and Northwest territories and establish a presence in the new territories before other growing countries could take over. Led by Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark, the group of 33 people and one dog left Missouri in March 1804 and spent 2.5 years on the journey, returning in September 1806."
1820,summary,"By 1820, the focus on transportation and expansion and begun in earnest.  The first short railroads had been built, including several gravity and horse-drawn railroads in Virginia and Pennsylvania.  Prior to the widespread
usage of the railroads, canals were the best option for transportation.  In 1817 construction on the Erie Canal began which ultimately led to the growth of New York City into the largest and most powerful city in the country, which it
remains to this day."
1830,summary,"The 1820's marked the incorporation of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad which would later become the first railroad in the United States to transport goods and people.  In Quincy, Massachusetts the Granite Railway was
founded to provide transportation for the granite used to create the Bunker Hill Monument. It was powered by horse.  In 1829, the first train to run on metal rails was incorporated in Pennsylvania and the first train to be powered by steam
was developed in Charleston, South Carolina.  It also held the distinction of being the longest railroad in the world at 3,800 feet."
1840,summary,"The 1830's marked the beginning of the westward expansion of every day citizens in search of new opportunities.  The Oregon Trail, initially used by fur trappers and explorers on foot and horseback was expanded to support
the use of wagons.  In 1836, the first wagon train of settlers left Independence, Missouri and headed west. On the east coast, new railroad lines were created and expansion continued."
1850,summary,"By 1850, the United States had finally met its goal of having a state on the west coast with its acquisition of California.  The population of the west continued to grow as the numbers of emigrants in the wagon trains increased.  By
1841, the trails had been improved to the point that settlers could reach the Pacific coast via the Oregon, California and Mormon trails. By 1849 nearly 100,000 gold prospectors arrived in California for the start of the California Gold Rush."
1860,summary,"By 1860, the US railroad system had increased to the point that it was possible to travel as far as Chicago, Illinois and Kansas City, Missouri by train.  Train technology had improved so much that it took less than two days to get from New York City to Chicago.  In addition, the trip to San Francisco decreased to the point that it took only 4 weeks to get there from New York after the Panama Canal Railway was created in 1855.  The trip no longer required travelling around the
southern end of South America."
1870,summary,"On May 10, 1869, the last spike of the first transcontinental railroad was driven at Promontory Peak, Utah.  It had taken 6 years and $50,000,000 to complete.  It was built by two railroad companies, the Central Pacific line
responsible for building the section from California to Utah and Union Pacific, who built the section from Iowa to Utah.  The new railroad made it possible to travel from New York City to San Francisco in as 
little as 7 days at a cost as low as $65. The railroad companies capitalized on the westward expansion by offering emigrant trains: low-cost, basic service trains that enabled almost anyone to move west.  "
1880,summary,"The 1870's were spent recovering from the devastation of the Civil War a decade earlier.  The US continued to expand its reach and take ownership of additional lands and also continued its Indian Removal Policy forcing all
Native Americans onto reservations.  As the railroads and general population expanded, the need for more Indian land was necessary.  These resulted in many conflicts between the US and Native Americans tribes throughout the decade. The 1870's
also marked the start of standard Time Zones, put in place for easier coordination for railroads across the country."
1890,summary,"By 1890, there were more than 165,000 miles of railroad tracks across the US.  The massive railroad corporations had paved the way for other corporations that grew out of the industrial revolution of that time such as
the Oriental Telephone and Standard Oil Companies. New technologies such as the telephone, light bulb and motion pictures were invented and became more mainstream."  
1900,summary,"By 1900, the US had reached its peak of growth.  It went from being less than half a percent of the world population in 1800 to 5%, a percentage that it holds today as the third largest country.  It had almost 200,000 miles of
railroad tracks stretching from every corner of the country. In its first full decade, its land area had grown by over 600% and its population had exploded by more than 1500% from its 5 million in 1800 to 75 million in 1900.  The US had gone
from being a small group of motivated settlers to a super-power in its own right."
