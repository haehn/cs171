1800,summary,"At the turn of the century, the United States was a new country, less than 25 years old and hardly noticable on a map.  Its population was less than that of New York City today and the western boundaries of the country
stretched to the wilderness at the Mississippi River.  At this time it took six weeks by horse to travel from New York City to present-day Chicago, which didn't yet exist.  There was no way to travel by land to the west coast and it took 
six months by ship to reach San Francisco, which had a population of less than 1000 people.  It existed only as a military outpost and religious mission."
1810,summary,"The years between 1800 and 1810 marked the first time that settlers travelled on foot to the west coast of current day America.  The Lewis and Clark expedition was commissioned in 1803 by President Jefferson to travel westward, 
find practical routes across the continent, map the newly acquired Louisiana, Southwest and Northwest territories and establish a presence in the new territories before other growing countries could take over. Led by Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark, the group of 33 people and one dog left Missouri in March 1804 and spent 2.5 years on the journey, returning in September 1806."
1820,summary,"By 1820, the focus on transportation and expansion and begun in earnest.  The first short railroads had been built, including several gravity and horse-drawn railroads in Virginia and Pennsylvania.  Prior to the widespread
usage of the railroads, canals were the best option for transportation.  In 1817 construction on the Erie Canal began which ultimately led to the growth of New York City into the largest and most powerful city in the country, which it
remains to this day."
1830,summary,"The 1820's marked the incorporation of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad which would later become the first railroad in the United States to transport goods and people.  In Quincy, Massachusetts the Granite Railway was
founded to provide transportation for the granite used to create the Bunker Hill Monument. It was powered by horse.  In 1829, the first train to run on metal rails was incorporated in Pennsylvania and the first train to be powered by steam
was developed in Charleston, South Carolina.  It also held the distinction of being the longest railroad in the world at 3,800 feet."
1840,summary,"The 1830's marked the beginning of the westward expansion of every day citizens in search of new opportunities.  The Oregon Trail, initially used by fur trappers and explorers on foot and horseback was expanded to support
the use of wagons.  In 1836, the first wagon train of settlers left Independence, Missouri and headed west. On the east coast, new railroad lines were created and expansion continued."
